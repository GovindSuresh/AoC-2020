# AoC-2020

Solutions to Advent of Code 2020 problems https://adventofcode.com/

Full questions can be found on the website. 

Each day's problems have been put into a separate folder. In certain cases I've provided multiple solutions (always good to practice with various approaches!)

I have not included the full input files I recieved for the problems. The creator of the challenges has previously asked users to not upload their input data to public repositories. You can get your own set of input data by signing up at the link above. I have provided the example data which was provided with each question. You can use to test the functions.
